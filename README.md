An implementation of the Miller-Rabin Primarity test algorithm in java. The code can be used to verify small and large primes with the user specifying the number of test rounds to be applied.
The algorithm can be found in [wikipedia_link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test).
It is used to check if a number is prime with very high accuracy even for very large primes.
